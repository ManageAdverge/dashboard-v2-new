## ✅ 1. Connect Google Ads data to the Campaign Performance Table on the Overview page
- Integrated Google Ads API for campaign performance data
- Replaced mock data in `CampaignTable` with live data
- Handled authentication and account selection for Google Ads
- Mapped API fields to table columns
- Added error/loading states for data fetching

## ✅ 2. Connect the filters to the Campaign Performance Table on the Overview page and make them function just like the scorecards
- Passed filter state to the data fetching logic for the table
- Table updates when filters change (campaign, type, status, date range)
- Filter logic is synced with scorecards (both update together)
- Tests for filter-to-table connection (manual/visual)

## ✅ 3. Connect Google Ads data to the Graphs on the Trends Page. Make sure that I can still see the YoY comparison based on the date range selection
- Integrated Google Ads API for trends/graph data
- Implemented data transformation for YoY (year-over-year) comparison
- Updated graph components to use live data
- Ensured date range selection updates both current and YoY data
- Added loading/error states for graphs

## ✅ 4. Connect the filters to the Graphs on the Trends page and make them function just like they do with the scorecards and campaign performance table on the overview page
- Passed filter state to graph data fetching logic
- Ensured graphs update on filter change
- Kept filter logic consistent across all dashboard elements
- Added tests for filter-to-graph connection

## 5. Set up test and production environments with full backup/versioning ("game save" style restore)
- Create separate test and production environments (e.g., using Vercel, Docker, or custom hosting)
- Use environment-specific config files for secrets, DB, and API keys
- Implement automated and manual backup of the entire codebase and database
  - Use git for code versioning (with protected branches, tags for releases, etc.)
  - Set up scheduled full backups of the production database (e.g., with Prisma, pg_dump, or managed DB tools)
  - Store backups in a secure, versioned location (cloud storage, S3, etc.)
- Add a "restore" workflow to roll back to any previous backup (code and DB)
  - Document the restore process (step-by-step)
  - Provide a UI or CLI for selecting and restoring backups if possible
- Add environment indicators to the dashboard UI (so users know if they're in test or production)
- Test the full backup/restore process regularly to ensure reliability
- Document all environment setup, backup, and restore steps in the repo README

## ✅ 6. Possibility to add multiple Client Accounts to the dashboard by adding extra Google Ads Account ID's in the field on the settings page
- UI in settings for entering multiple Google Ads Account IDs is complete
- Backend and DB support for multiple account IDs and multiple selected IDs is complete
- Data fetching logic supports multiple accounts
- User can add, select, and use multiple accounts in the dashboard
- All dashboard data (scorecards, tables, graphs) respects selected account(s)

**Next up:**
- Known issue: Scorecards are still off by one day compared to the campaign performance table (date range/timezone edge case under investigation)
- Finish advanced trends/graph visualizations
- Implement advanced error handling for Google Ads API edge cases
- Add export, advanced reporting, and campaign comparison features
- Add email notifications, API rate limiting, and caching
- Continue improving UI/UX for multi-account workflows
